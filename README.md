## Notes

This repository contains 230 words from the nearly extinct Kusunda language. These words were elicited with help of the [250 item list](https://concepticon.clld.org/contributions/Sagart-2019-250) underlying the study of [Sagart et al. (2019)](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1817972116) on Sino-Tibetan languages.

If synonyms occurred, we tokenize the first form. However, the following words are selected for tokenization according to the author's suggestions. 

| Gloss   | Chosen form          | Remark                                                                          |
|---------|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| above   | "ɐ̃ː.ʤi" and "ɐŋ.ʣeː" | these two words are selected to reconstruct the Proto-form                      |
| hundred | "sɐj"                |                                                                                 |
| to chew | "kʰɐm.kʰɐm ɐ.gɔː"    | lit. "bite-bite-do". It's a new form, the meaning is "to bite again and again". |
