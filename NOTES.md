This repository contains 230 words from the nearly extinct Kusunda language. These words were elicited with help of the [250 item list](https://concepticon.clld.org/contributions/Sagart-2019-250) underlying the study of [Sagart et al. (2019)](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1817972116) on Sino-Tibetan languages.
